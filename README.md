# Radix Vue

[Radix Vue](https://github.com/mukundshah/radix-vue) is an unofficial port of [Radix UI Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for Vue 3.

> I started this as a leanrning project to know more about component libraries and Vue 3. [Radix Svelte](https://github.com/TGlide/radix-svelte) inspired me to take this beyond a learning project. I hope this will be useful for someone. A lot of work is still pending. I will be adding more components and improving the existing ones.

## Installation

**Radix Vue** is yet to be published to NPM. You can install it from GitHub to play around with it.

```bash
npm install --save  https://github.com/mukundshah/radix-vue
yarn add -D  https://github.com/mukundshah/radix-vue
pnpm add -D  https://github.com/mukundshah/radix-vue
```

## Contributing

**Contributions are strongly welcome and encouraged!**

I work on this project in my free time. I will try to review and merge PRs as soon as possible. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.
